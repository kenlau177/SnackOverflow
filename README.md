## Troubleshooting:

- if you see all the .jars but the project is still
reporting errors (files are red), right click on the
project, select "Build Path" and then "Configure Build Path"
- Under "Order and Export" uncheck all BUT the /src and
/test
- press "OK"
- Then re-add the stuff you unchecked
