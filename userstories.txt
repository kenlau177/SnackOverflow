Data Display:

   when I parse the data it should be sorted under the correct headings such as "beer", "wine", etc.
        - there should be a drop down menu which displays to users the possible categories for wines.
        - then another drop down menu appears which can be price, so the user can narrow the search
          results further.
        - If price isn't listed, then it will simply say 'unknown'
        - when I select the categories or prices or liquor, it should not be ambiguous (such as text boxes)
        drop down menus are a good way to prevent typos since it only offers you a certain choices
        - check that the number of columns are correct in my table otherwise display warning.
        - check that the table does not exceed a certain size otherwise display error, and tell
				the user to re-enter search.
